Title - "Pizzahut : Pizza Sales Analysis"

In this project, I analyzed Pizza Hut's sales data to understand customer behavior and improve business strategies. The goal was to answer basic, intermediate, and advanced questions related to pizza sales, such as revenue contributions, popular pizza sizes, and customer order patterns. 
To evaluate overall sales performance, understand customer preferences by analyzing pizza types and sizes, track revenue contributions from different categories, and identify key business patterns to improve decision-making.
The project was built using SQL queries executed in MySQL Workbench, which allowed me to manipulate and analyze data effectively.üçïüçΩÔ∏è
